Pipelined Reliable Data Transfer on UDP (But not completed! Especially packet timeout part.)

As description says, these 2 files are for pipelined reliable data transfer on UDP.

First compile each of these files, then run receiver first. 
If you run it, cmd will tell you to input packet loss probability. (It is double value.)
After you input it, the receiver will wait for packets from sender side.

Run sender, and then input values of IP Address, Window size, Timeout interval, and file name.
Then the sender will send packet to receiver.
